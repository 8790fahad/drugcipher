<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>DrugCipher enables drug manufacturers to record their drug data on the blockchain using NEAR protocol, these drug data are then encrypted on Secured QR codes that are going to be placed on drug containers, packets, and blister packs for scan purposes. Manufacturers can also recall their products rendering them unusable. The DrugCipher mobile app enables patients to scan the QR code and check the authenticity of drugs while earning tokens to promote consumer protection. For each scanned drug, manufacturers are able to track the scan location on their web interface.</p>
